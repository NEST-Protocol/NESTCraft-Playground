# NESTCraft-playground

A given random information flow can be transformed by various functions to obtain a series of martingales, which can be
used for the NEST martingale transactions.

We call these functions for martingalizing random information flows martingale functions. If we relax the martingale standard and choose to accept more super martingales, the scope of
application of the trading will become larger, but unless these martingales are insensitive to traders, it is easy to
reduce demand and reduce the enthusiasm for participation. Of course, this only adds a variety of options for traders.
As long as someone accepts this design, it will provide more supply on the original basis.
